In recent years, the demand for efficient and hassle-free eating experiences has led to an unparalleled growth in the food delivery industry. Food delivery services are now easier to use and more accessible because to the proliferation of smartphones and mobile applications. This project intends to use the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) stack to create a complete food delivery program in order to meet this increasing need.
Customers will able to explore and place meal orders from their preferred restaurants with ease thanks to the suggested software. Among the softwareâ€™s primary features will be:

-	Onboarding and menu management for restaurants.
-	Add-to-cart and ordering features.
-	Integration of secure payment gateway.
-	Order tracking and delivery status updates in real time.
-	Google Maps API-based tracking of delivery agents.
The MERN stack, which provides a stable and expandable framework for creating dynamic web applications, will be used to construct the program. This project intends to provide a high-performance, feature-rich, and user-friendly food delivery software that satisfies the changing demands of the market by utilizing the advantages of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.
